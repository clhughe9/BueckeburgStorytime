I was driving in my Porsche to Raesfeld one sunny day. As I drove down the hauptstrasse, I spotted the most adorable couple walking alongside the road, dressed in lederhosen and a dirndel. They looked to be headed to a biergarten, and I was envious, for I was hungry and could go for a bratwurst. But my plans were disrupted by a parade crossing the road, bearing what had to be the world's largest apfelkuchen.
